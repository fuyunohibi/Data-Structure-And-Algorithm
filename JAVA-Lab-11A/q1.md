# Task 1:
Given thisGraph = (V,E) which 
V = {A, B, C, D, E} and 
E = { (A,B,3), (A,E,2), (B,C,1), (C,D,4), (D,E,5) }

1.1 write int [][] thisGraph =

```
int[][] thisGraph = {
    //   A  B  C  D  E
    {  0, 3, 0, 0, 2},  // A
    {  3, 0, 1, 0, 0},  // B
    {  0, 1, 0, 4, 0},  // C
    {  0, 0, 4, 0, 5},  // D
    {  2, 0, 0, 5, 0}   // E
}; 
```


1.2 draw thisGraph

```
   (A)
   / \
 3/   \2
 /     \
(B)   (E)
 |     |
 | 1   | 5
 |     | 
(C)---(D)
    4

```

#### Explanation:
- (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) are the vertices.
- Lines between the vertices represent edges.
- The numbers next to the lines are the weights of those edges.
- Given the adjacency matrix, you can see:

- A connection from A to B with a weight of 3.
- A connection from A to E with a weight of 2.
- A connection from B to C with a weight of 1.
- A connection from C to D with a weight of 4.
- A connection from D to E with a weight of 5.
